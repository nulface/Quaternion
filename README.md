# Quaternion

#### This class allows creation and use of quaternions for rotations in 3d

Difficult to understand, simple and powerful to use!

[Here](https://eater.net/quaternions) is an excellent description of how quaternions work. 
This was my reference and inspiration for making this project.

Quaternions allow you to rotate around any arbitrary unit vector and most importantly avoids the dreaded gimbal lock problem.
